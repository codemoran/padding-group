Welcome to rightpad.io and its sister <a href="http://leftpad.io">leftpad.io</a>, the new **STANDARDIZED** way to
pad your strings.

## Aren't there services for this already?

Yes, there is <a href="http://left-pad.io">left-pad.io</a>, and then <a href="http://right-pad.io">right-pad.io</a> launched.

## Well then why do we need another way to do things?

* They cannot keep up with the speed of business.
* They are not webscale.
* They do not have the agile, the devops or the lean baked into the heart of
  their product.
* They do not share a consistent interface, left-pad.io uses `api.left-pad.io`,
  and right-pad.io uses `right-pad.io/api`, how can you be expected to remember
  two different ways of doing the same thing?

Here at **The Padding Group**, our mandate is and will always be,
_to change the world_.

If people could not pad their strings, it would mean that no one could read a
number, or format a piece of text, the fate of the literate world rested on our
mortal shoulders crying out for a standardized solution, and we delivered.

## Doesn't this change make an already fragmented system even worse?
#### reference relevant <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">xkcd</a> I saw on reddit and hackernews

You would think that.  But if everyone switched over to us, the system would not
be fragmented, we would become the new standard.  So while it may seem like that
in theory, you would be incorrect.

## You mentioned something about the other services having limits?

* right-pad has not disclosed their limits, so we assume they are not sufficient.
* left-pad, can only pad up to 1024 characters, and what if you need more than
  1024 characters? You need to email a salesperson to have your limit raised for
  an undisclosed sum of money.

Your company is being held hostage by an unknown company with hyphens in their
URL at the time when you need to scale the most, and you have no idea what the
ransom is.

## I cannot grow my company with those types of restrictions!

At <a href="rightpad.io">rightpad.io</a>, we have doubled the limit from 1024 to 2048, allowing you to
scale your business.

## What if 2048 are not enough characters?  Isn't this the same problem?

You would think that.  But no one has ever needed a string larger than 2048
characters, we checked.

## Why should I trust you more than right-pad.io?

With left-pad and right-pad they have hyphens in the name, and you cannot trust a
company or an api with a hyphen in their name, that's just science.

No one uses goo-gle.com, they use google.com right?

## So what happens next?

After talking with our potential VC, and given the world impact of this product,
we estimate it is most certainly a billion-dollar market opportunity.  We are
building the product correctly, using only the shiniest of languages and hipster
terminologies, we are assured with the right slide deck will succeed.  So you
are assured we will be around for a long time, or at least until we get
acqui-hired.

rightpad.io is more trustworthy, it has the correct limits in place to enable you
to grow and scale your business.  Also we use the agile, the devops and the lean,
so you know its webscale.

## That sounds amazing, my CIO will love this, How do I use it??

We looked at the "REST" implementation of `api.left-pad.io` and then the "REST"
implementation of `right-pad.io/api`, and it was obvious they were doing it
completely wrong.

Why are they using the query string to pass in parameters, when you **SHOULD**
be using HTTP headers so Hackers cannot see your data.

Look at this URL, <a href="https://right-pad.io/api?str=hackers-can-see-this&len=68&ch=!">https://right-pad.io/api?str=hackers-can-see-this&len=68&ch=!</a>
a hacker can see EXACTLY what you are trying to right-pad, do you want to be
responsible for Hackers having access to all of your data?

## Well than, what is the RIGHT way to do this?

You need to hide the data in the headers so hackers cannot see them.  We at
**The Padding Group** have been pioneers in leading the SecOps benefits of
**Header Driven Development**.

```
$ curl 'https://secure.rightpad.io' \
-H "X-STR: hackers-cannot-see-me-they-just-see-secure.rightpad.io" \
-H "X-LEN: 64" \
-H "X-CH: !"
{"str":"hackers-cannot-see-me-they-just-see-secure.rightpad.io!!!!!!!!!!"}
```

The header parameters names `X-STR`, `X-LEN`, and `X-CH` are the same as the
`left-pad` and `right-pad.io` just more secure, so swapping over to
<a href="https://rightpad.io">rightpad.io</a> should be a breeze.

## What did I just finish reading?

Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/gabrielgironda">@gabrielgironda</a> for making me laugh, we at the Padding Group
apprecaite you (<a href="https://twitter.com/codemoran">@codemoran</a>).
